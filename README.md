### Example of using (3) nested routes in Laravel 

# Technology:
- PHP
- Laravel 
- JQuery
- Bootstrap

# What does this application do?
The premise of this application is to manage INI files. The application is split into two parts: 
- 1] Defining what an INI file can contain in an administrative fashion.
- 2] Creating an INI file from a definition.

Note:
There is no real world application here, this is an example of how I approached creating an application in Laravel.
